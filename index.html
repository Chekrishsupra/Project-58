      <p> My favorite hobby is swimming because it refreshes our body the moment you get into the water. You can relax in swimming pools quietly and no one will disturb you. The good thing is that swimming keeps you fit because when you swim your body has to balance you and keep you floating on the surface of water. There are many strokes in swimming for example: freestyle, backstroke, butterfly etc.</p>
